Linear, Lasso, Ridge Regressions comparison over https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html

Current findings 

# Linear Regression
# Strengths: Simple, interpretable, efficient with large datasets.
# Weaknesses: Sensitive to multicollinearity, assumes linearity, impacted by outliers.

# Lasso Regression
# Strengths: Performs feature selection, reduces complexity, useful for high-dimensional data.
# Weaknesses: Struggles with correlated features, sensitive to regularization parameter.

# Ridge Regression
# Strengths: Reduces overfitting, handles multicollinearity, works well with correlated features.
# Weaknesses: Doesn't perform feature selection, sensitive to regularization parameter.

# Logistic Regression
# Strengths: Effective for binary classification, provides probabilistic outputs, efficient and interpretable.
# Weaknesses: Assumes linear decision boundary, struggles with correlations or imbalanced classes.
